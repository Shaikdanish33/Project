# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom Industry

### 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict customer churn and provide actionable strategies to help a telecom company retain its customers in a highly competitive environment.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Telecom companies face high competition and often lose customers without knowing the exact reasons. By analyzing customer behavior and predicting churn in advance, businesses can take smart actions to improve customer satisfaction and reduce losses.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes details like:
- Customer demographics
- Contract details
- Monthly and total charges
- Internet service types
- Tech support and payment methods
- Churn status (Yes/No)

---

## ⚒️ Tools & Libraries Used

### 🔧 Tools:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

### 📚 Libraries:
- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
- `scikit-learn` – ML models and metrics
- `ELI5` – Model explainability
- `plotly` (optional) – Interactive visualizations

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:
- **Churn is highest** for month-to-month contracts.
- **Fiber optic internet** users show more churn.
- **Customers without tech support** are more likely to churn.
- **Short-tenure customers** are at higher risk.

Charts included:
- Churn by Contract Type
- Churn by Internet Service
- Churn by Monthly Charges
- Churn by Tenure
- Churn by Payment Method, Tech Support, and Senior Citizen status

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### ✅ Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

I used **ELI5** to interpret feature importance and understand which variables influence churn the most.

## 🧩 Customer Segmentation

Customers were segmented into:
- **At Risk** – New customers predicted to churn
- **Loyal** – Long-tenure customers who won’t churn
- **Dormant** – Low total spend and not likely to churn
- **Others** – Not falling into above categories

This helps in personalizing communication and campaigns.

## 📝 Final Recommendations

- 📌 Focus on new customers with targeted offers
- 🔒 Lock-in customers with long-term contracts
- 🌐 Improve internet service quality (especially for fiber users)
- 💳 Promote secure and auto-payment methods
- 👴 Simplify plans and support for senior citizens
- 🛠️ Offer tech support trials to non-users
- 🧠 Deploy the prediction model in real-time to flag churn risk
